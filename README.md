# The Online Atlas of Integer Sequences

The Online Atlas of Integer Sequences (OAIS) is a love letter to Neil Sloane's [Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)](http://oeis.org/).

While an amazing repository of information, the visual functionality of the OEIS leaves something to be desired. That is where the Online Atlas of Integer Sequences comes in.

Each sequence in the OEIS has a sequence ID of the form "A######". To use the OAIS, type any sequence ID into the search box (you may omit the A and leading 0s if you like).

An example of a sequence in the OEIS is the [Lucas numbers, sequence ID A000032](http://oeis.org/A000032). The first few terms are:

2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 521, 843, 1364,...

To explore the Lucas numbers in the OAIS, search 32 in the search bar.

The OAIS offers exploration of a sequence by allowing you to view a sequence dynamically using the dropdown toolbar. A gradient is applied to the sequence, which can be viewed as a list or a triangular array. A modulus can be applied, both to the numbers themselves and to the coloring. There are also dynamic graphs that show the growth of a sequence.
